I guess I couldn't sit around on a domain name for so long without finally creating a web presence. So here it is, my latest blog.

For now I'm going to give it a shot with [zola](https://www.getzola.org), which is a rust alternative to the often used [hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I'm hosting it directly on a tiny VPS with nginx for now, let's see if that works out, or whether I need to go an S3 like route. I doubt I'll get that much traffic, but perhaps throwing a CDN in front might help when getting slashdotted?

<aside>Slashdot was a website that people used to use in the early 2000s in order to get angry about privacy issues and Linux</aside>

Either way, hi. I'm Ben, a software developer based in Berlin for the last decade.
