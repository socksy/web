## Navel gazing
Hi there, my name is Ben. I originally hail from the UK, being born in [Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford). Later on my family moved to a place near [Reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading,_Berkshire), where I went to [Reading School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_School), a school with the buildings of a private school but with the budget of a state school.

Afterwards I went to the [University of St Andrews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Andrews)[^sta] to study Computer Science for my undergraduate, briefly staying in Edinburgh for a summer in 2013. 

[^sta]: My mother's side of the family hail from [Ayr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayr) on the west coast of Scotland, and I am to understand that the east coast is full of elitists (and St Andrews especially as a place where toffs go to party rather than to learn). I am not sure if they were necessarily wrong.

After uni I moved to [Berlin, Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin), where I planned to see for a couple of years before moving on to somewhere else with the full advantages of an EU citizenship.

10 years later, I am now a joint [German citizen](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kartoffel), and I am frequently told by British people that I sound German, not British. Unfortunately this has not translated much into my own language abilities, which flux around a B2 in German at the best of times.

## Tech
With regards to tech, I've been lost in that field since a long time. At the age of 9 I asked my father how I could make a computer game, and he showed me the basics of `if`, `printf` and `scanf` in C. I dutifully made a question and answer game, and was very proud of myself (despite the segfaults). 


The next day he came back looking a bit sullen. "I asked around at the office and have found out I shouldn't have taught you C. Apparently you should be learning Java instead". From there, a life of misery awaited me.
