Hi there, my name is Ben. I originally hail from the UK, being born in [Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford). Later on my family moved to a place near [Reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading,_Berkshire), where I went to [Reading School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_School), a school with the buildings of a private school but with the budget of a state school.

Afterwards I went to the [University of St Andrews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Andrews) to study Computer Science for my undergraduate, briefly staying in Edinburgh for a summer in 2013. My mother's side of the family hail from [Ayr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayr) on the west coast of Scotland, and I am to understand that the east coast is full of elistists (and St Andrews especially as a place where toffs go to party rather than to learn). I am not sure if they were necessarily wrong.

After uni I moved to [Berlin, Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin), where I planned to see for a couple of years before moving on to somewhere else with the full advantages of an EU citizenship.

10 years later, I am now a joint [German citizen](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kartoffel), and I am frequently told by British people that I sound German, not British. Unfortunately this has not translated much into my own language abilities, which flux around a B2 in German at the best of times.
